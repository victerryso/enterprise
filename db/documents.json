Endeavour (International) Limited is incorporated and listed in Australia, with a reporting date of 31 December 2013.\r\n\r\nThe enclosed financial report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and Australian Accounting Standards. The report is intended to illustrate the disclosure requirements of the Accounting Standards, including providing interpretive commentary where necessary.\r\n\r\nThis financial report is illustrative only and does not attempt to show all possible accounting and disclosure requirements. It is essential to refer to the relevant authoritative source and, where necessary, seek appropriate professional advice. Although the illustrative financial report attempts to show the most common disclosure requirements for industrial companies, it should not be regarded as a comprehensive checklist. For a more comprehensive list of disclosure requirements, please refer to Ernst \u0026 Young's Financial reporting standards disclosure checklist. Enquiries regarding specialised industries and areas of accounting (e.g., insurance, US GAAP) should be directed to an Ernst \u0026 Young professional.\r\n\r\nEach section of the financial report of the Group is cross-referenced to commentary. Source references to the authoritative literature are also provided. The commentary follows the disclosure contained in each section of the financial report and is intended to highlight disclosure requirements of the note or to explain the approach taken in providing the illustrative disclosure in this report.\r\n\r\nWhat’s new in this update?\r\nThis edition of Endeavour (International) Limited includes financial reporting developments that have occurred since the January 2013 edition.

To reflect current practice and development, certain changes to the impairment disclosures have been made in this edition.\r\n\r\nImpairment disclosures are summarised in the following notes:\r\n􏰗 Accounting policy disclosures                                                Note 2\r\n􏰗 Disclosures for significant assumptions                                  Note 3\r\n􏰗 Property, plant and equipment                                                Note 15\r\n􏰗 Intangible assets                                                                     Note 17\r\n􏰗 Other financial assets                                                             Note 18\r\n􏰗 Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives                 Note 19\r\n􏰗 Trade receivables                                                                    Note 21                                                                  \r\n\r\n","user_id":1,"created_at":"2014-07-22T15:25:37.467Z","updated_at":"2014-07-22T15:25:37.467Z","pagenumber":4},{"id":5,"title":"Introduction (continued)","content":"Allowed alternative treatments\r\nIn some cases, an Australian Accounting Standard permits more than one accounting treatment for a transaction or event. Preparers of financial statements should select the treatment that is most relevant to their business and the relevant circumstances as their accounting policy.\r\n\r\nAASB 108 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, requires an entity to select and apply its accounting policies consistently for similar transactions, events and/or conditions, unless an Australian Accounting Standard requires or permits categorisation of items for which different policies may be appropriate. Where an Australian Accounting Standard requires or permits such categorisation, an appropriate accounting policy is selected and applied consistently to each category. Therefore, once a choice of one of the alternative treatments has been made, it becomes an accounting policy and must be applied consistently. Changes in accounting policy should only be made if required by a standard or interpretation, or if the change results in the financial statements providing more reliable and relevant information.\r\n\r\nIn this publication, when a choice is permitted by an Australian Accounting Standard, the Group has adopted one of the treatments as appropriate to the circumstances of the Group. In these cases the commentary provides details of which policy has been selected, the reasons for this policy selection, and the difference in the disclosure requirements.\r\n\r\nFinancial review by management\r\nMany entities present a financial review by management that is outside the financial statements. The Australian Accounting Standards do not require the presentation of such information, although paragraph 13 of AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements gives a brief outline of what may be included in an annual report. The AASB issued an AASB Practice Statement Management Commentary in December 2010, which provides a broad, non-binding framework for the presentation of a management commentary that relates to financial statements prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards. If a company decides to follow the guidance in the Practice Statement, management is encouraged to explain the extent to which the Practice Statement has been followed. A statement of compliance with the Practice Statement is only permitted if it is followed in its entirety.\r\n\r\nFurther, the content of a financial review by management in relation to the financial statements is often determined by the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001.\r\n\r\nAustralian Accounting Standards\r\nWhen complying with Australian Accounting Standards, preparers also need to comply with all applicable amending standards and interpretations.\r\n\r\nAustralian Accounting Standards applicable as at 31 October 2013\r\nThe standards applied in these illustrative financial statements are those that were in issue as at 31 August 2013 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. Standards issued, but not yet effective, as at 1 January 2013 have generally not been early adopted. It is important to note that these illustrative financial statements will require continual updating as standards are issued and/or revised.\r\n\r\nUsers of this publication are cautioned to check that there has been no change in requirements of standards between 31 October 2013 and the date on which their financial statements are authorised for issue. In accordance with AASB 108.30, specific disclosure requirements apply for standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective (see Note 2.3(ii) of these illustrative financial statements). Furthermore, if the financial year of an entity is other than the calendar year, new and revised standards applied in these illustrative financial statements may not be applicable. For example, the Group has applied AASB 11 Joint Arrangements (and also AASB 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and AASB 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities) for the first time in these illustrative financial statements. An entity with a financial year that commences from, for example, 1 October and ends on 30 September must apply AASB 11 for the first time in the annual financial statements beginning on 1 October 2013. Therefore, AASB 11 is not applicable in the financial statements with a year-end on 30 September 2013, unless it voluntarily chooses to early-adopt.\r\n\r\n\r\n","user_id":1,"created_at":"2014-07-22T15:34:59.414Z","updated_at":"2014-07-22T15:34:59.414Z","pagenumber":5},{"id":6,"title":"Introduction (continued)","content":"Australian Accounting Standards applicable as at 31 October 2013 (continued)\r\n\r\nIn addition, the disclosure requirements of the following Australian Accounting Standards are not applicable to the Group and have therefore not been dealt with in the financial report:\r\nAASB 1 First Time Adoption of Australian Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards\r\nAASB 4 Insurance Contracts\r\nAASB 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources\r\nAASB 9  Financial Instruments\r\nAASB 111 Construction Contracts\r\nAASB 129 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies\r\nAASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting*\r\nAASB 141 Agriculture**\r\nAASB 1004 Contributions\r\nAASB 1023 General Insurance Contracts\r\nAASB 1038 Life Insurance Contracts\r\nAASB 1039 Concise Financial Reports\r\nAASB 1049 Whole of Government and General Government Sector Financial Reporting\r\nAASB 1050 Administered Items\r\nAASB 1051 Land Under Roads\r\nAASB 1052 Disaggregated Disclosures\r\nAASB 1053 Application of Tiers of Accounting Standards*\r\nAASB 1055 Budgetary Reporting\r\nAAS       25 Financial Reporting by Superannuation Plans\r\nInterpretation 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under AASB 129 Financial Reporting in       Hyperinflationary Economies\r\nInterpretation 12 Service Concession Arrangements\r\nInterpretation 13 Customer Loyalty Programs\r\nInterpretation 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate\r\nInterpretation 20 Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine\r\nInterpretation 21 Levies*\r\nInterpretation 107 Introduction of the Euro\r\nInterpretation 110 Government Assistance — No Specific Relation to Operating Activities\r\nInterpretation 125 Income Taxes – Changes in the Tax Status of an Entity or its Shareholders\r\nInterpretation 129 Service Concession Arrangements: Disclosures\r\nInterpretation 131 Revenue — Barter Transactions Involving Advertising Services\r\nInterpretation 132 Intangible Assets — Web Site Costs\r\nInterpretation 1003 Australian Petroleum Resource Rent Tax\r\nInterpretation 1038 Contributions by Owners Made to Wholly-Owned Public Sector Entities\r\nInterpretation 1042 Subscriber Acquisition Costs in the Telecommunications Industry\r\nInterpretation 1047 Professional Indemnity Claims Liabilities in Medical Defence Organisations\r\nInterpretation 1055 Accounting for Road Earthworks\r\n* An example half-year financial report in accordance with AASB 134 is included in Appendix C.\r\n** Example disclosures for agricultural assets are included as a guide in Appendix B.\r\n\r\nOther changes\r\nOther changes from the January 2013 edition have been made in order to reflect practice developments and to improve the overall quality of the illustrative financial statements.\r\n\r\nIn order to illustrate the impact of transition to some of the new or amended standards mentioned above, in this edition certain scenarios are revised and new scenarios not existing in January 2013 edition are introduced.

Australian companies will therefore be adopting, amongst others, the new standards on consolidation and joint operations for the first time. The new consolidation standard represents a significant change to the process of determining which entities are included in consolidated financial statements, while the new standard for joint arrangements aims to better reflect the substance of these arrangements and eliminate the choice of accounting that has existed to date.\r\n\r\nA key objective for issuing the new standards is to increase the comparability and transparency of financial reporting. For example, even if management determines that it does not control another entity, management still must disclose the information that is considered in reaching that decision, so its judgement becomes more transparent. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) agenda also reflects the need for increased transparency in financial reporting.\r\n\r\nAustralian companies continue to experience pressure on asset valuations due to continuing economic uncertainty affecting cash flow forecasts. In this context, ASIC has continued to focus on how companies apply the impairment standard via its annual surveillance programs and disclosures relating to impairment continue to be increasingly sensitive. This edition reflects developments in current practice in this area. The comprehensive impairment disclosures should serve as a useful means of comparison when companies prepare the impairment disclosures in the forthcoming reporting season.\r\n\r\nThis new edition of Endeavour also illustrates the application of AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement and the amendments to AASB 119 Employee Benefits and AASB 136 Impairment.\r\n\r\nEndeavour is designed to assist you with your disclosures when preparing your own financial reports. It continues to be closely aligned with Good Group – our illustrative financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), which will facilitate comparability with overseas companies.\r\n\r\nThe International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) continues to move forward with its standard-setting activities and the ability to plot a steady course in a sea of upcoming change is critical. Further developments in the new standards on leases, revenue recognition and financial instruments are anticipated in the coming year.\r\n\r\nI trust this publication will be a useful benchmark when preparing your financial statement disclosures for this reporting season.\r\n\r\n![Alt text](/Desktop/Screen Shot 2014-07-21 at 12.38.12.png)\r\nLynda Tomkins\r\nPartner and National Leader — IFRS Desk Ernst \u0026 Young Australia\r\n2 December 2013","user_id":1,"created_at":"2014-07-22T13:52:03.451Z","updated_at":"2014-07-23T01:15:15.327Z","pagenumber":1},{"id":13,"title":"Directors' report (continued)","content":"Principal activities\r\nThe principal activities during the year of entities within the consolidated entity were:                   CA 299(1)(c)\r\n􏰗 Supply and servicing of electronic equipment for defence, aviation and electrical safety markets\r\n􏰗 Production, installation and servicing of extinguishers, fire prevention equipment and fire retardant fabrics\r\n􏰗 Production of rubber hosepipes for commercial applications\r\n􏰗 Leasing of offices and manufacturing sites that are surplus to the Group's requirements\r\n\r\nOther than the discontinuance of the rubber equipment segment which came about through the decision to distribute Hose Limited to the shareholders of the Company, there have been no other significant changes in the nature of these activities during the year.\r\nOperating and financial review                                                                                                  CA 299(1)(a) \r\n                                                                                                                                                   CA 299A(1) \r\n                                                                                                                                                   ASX 4.10.17\r\nWe have not illustrated the disclosures required in the operating and financial review of Endeavour (International) Limited.

The movement was largely the result of increased profits. A further $7,203,000 of contributed equity was issued to facilitate the acquisition of Extinguishers Limited. Refer Note 23 for further information on movements in equity.\r\n\r\nThe Group is in the final stage of facilitating the distribution of Hose Limited. This is discussed in further detail above.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of Extinguishers Limited has further strengthened the fire prevention division of the Group. This company has a well-established research and development department, which will help ensure that the Group's products remain state-of-the-art. Additionally, the acquisition of Extinguishers Limited has allowed the Group to gain control of a significant fire prevention patent, thus ensuring future strong sales opportunities for the Group.\r\n\r\nSignificant events after the balance date                                                                                       CA 299(1)(d)\r\nOn 14 January 2014, a building with a net book value of $1,695,000 and inventory with a net book value of $857,000 was severely damaged by flooding resulting in estimated impairment losses of $2,552,000. It is expected that insurance proceeds will fall short of the costs of rebuilding and the loss of inventories by $750,000.
